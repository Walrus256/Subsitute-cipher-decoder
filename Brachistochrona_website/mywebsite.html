      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <p>
        In physics and mathematics, a brachistochrone curve, or curve of fastest
        descent, is the one lying on the plane between a point A and a lower
        point B, where B is not directly below A, on which a bead slides
        frictionlessly under the influence of a uniform gravitational field to a
        given end point in the shortest time. The problem was posed by Johann
        Bernoulli in 1696. The brachistochrone curve is the same shape as the
        tautochrone curve; both are cycloids. However, the portion of the
        cycloid used for each of the two varies. More specifically, the
        brachistochrone can use up to a complete rotation of the cycloid (at the
        limit when A and B are at the same level), but always starts at a cusp.
        In contrast, the tautochrone problem can use only up to the first half
        rotation, and always ends at the horizontal. The problem can be solved
        using tools from the calculus of variations and optimal control. The
        curve is independent of both the mass of the test body and the local
        strength of gravity. Only a parameter is chosen so that the curve fits
        the starting point A and the ending point B. If the body is given an
        initial velocity at A, or if friction is taken into account, then the
        curve that minimizes time differs from the tautochrone curve.
